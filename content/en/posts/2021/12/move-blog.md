## next.js to hugo

I found out that there is a program that can easily create a static site with go
binaries.

The library [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is very fast because it's made with go.

It's also very easy to change the theme, which I really appreciate.

Anyway, I don't have a habit of writing blogs, so it probably doesn't mean much
to me.
