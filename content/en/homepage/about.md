## Self Introduction

- This is the story of an unskilled NEET who started programming in 2020/6.
- My favorite languages are Rust, TypeScript, PowerShell, and Python.

## Brief history of programming since I started

2019/12:

- I started learning Java on paiza.
- However, I got bored quickly because I couldn't make the program (GUI) I had
  in mind.
- I felt that I wasn't good at programming and lost interest in it.

2020/6:

- The word "AI" made me start programming again.
- My friend was busy writing his thesis, so we couldn't play Monster Hunter
  together for a while.
- Also, I was interested in the source code of the save data modification editor
  for Monster Hunter Double Cross, which was made in C #.

2020/7:.

- It took me a month to learn and understand the basic syntax of Python class
  inheritance. It was pretty tough.

2020/8.

- I tried learning machine learning at [PyQ](https://pyq.jp/), a pay site that
  costs 3,040 yen/month.
- The math was too difficult for me, as I graduated from a bottom-ranked high
  school with a deviation of 36, and I couldn't fully understand it.
- I also created an Android app using Kotlin, a language designed to make Java
  easier to write. However, I only mimicked the samples on Google's official
  website, and I hardly understood the meaning of the syntax.

2020/9:.

- Annoyed by sites that forbid copying and pasting, I start learning JavaScript,
  which will be my partner in the future, at
  [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/ja/docs/Web).
- Understand prototype in a week. (Because it was almost similar to classes).
- Learn the basics of HTML and CSS at the same time.

2020/10 - 2020/12

- MDN has a lot of information, but there are also a lot of descriptions that
  are difficult to understand, which makes it difficult for me to develop my
  skills as much as I would like.
- As a result, learning becomes increasingly difficult and I slack off for a
  while.

2021/1.

- Took Udemy's
  [[JavaScript & CSS] Thorough Practice of Web Development for People Who Really Want to Learn (Front End)](https://www.udemy.com/course/front-dev-tutorial/).
  This was a hit, and I learned all the way through, regaining a sense of growth
  and enjoyment.
- I also bought
  [A Logical Explanation of JavaScript Behavior: The Road to Intermediate JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/road-to-javascript-master/)
  and learned it well, and JavaScript became completely fun. I'm having a lot of
  fun with JavaScript.

2021/2:

- Reviewed the course I took in January.

2021/3:

- 2021/3: Learn about modern front-end development techniques using Node.js.
- 2021/3: Learn modern front-end development methods with Node.js. I took a
  course called
  [Introduction to Webpack Environment Construction for Active Engineers with Babel｜Sass｜Eslint](https://www.udemy.com/course/front-env-setting-webpack/)
  and finished it in three days. I got tendinitis from typing too much on the
  hard key-touch keyboard.

- Since then, I've been unable to write code properly due to tendinitis. That's
  not to say that I didn't take in any information at all, I was constantly
  scouring programming news articles and reading the documentation for Vue, a UI
  framework.

2021/4:

- Began writing Vue and learning more about TypeScript.
- However, I soon developed a severe pain in my fingers and could not type
  properly.

2021/5:

- Purchased a high-end capacitance-free keyboard for about 25,000 yen. It was a
  hit and I was able to type again. Started studying again.
- Started working on React.

2021/6:

- I try to create a [blog](https://github.com/SARDONYX-sard/tsx-sard-blog) with
  React (create-react-app, Next.js).
- I finally understood class components from the official documentation, but I
  had to relearn that modern development uses function components and Hooks,
  which at the time were called Advanced in the documentation. useEffect and
  useState were difficult to use.

2021/7:

- I found TypeScript interesting, and started to look for information on Qiita
  and Zenn. uhyo's article was especially useful for me.

2021/8:

- 2021/8: Learned about [scoop](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop), a
  package manager for windows. This will be very helpful for me.
- Setting up the development environment for PowerShell Core.

2021/9:

- Update to windows 11 beta. Although I was afraid of the bug that the screen
  becomes black and white and unresponsive when I change the color theme, I was
  delighted by the joy of being able to bring WSL GUI to windows, and even more
  delighted by the existence of an official package manager called winget.

2021/11:

- Discovered Rust, was impressed by the ease of installation using rustup, read
  the official Japanese documentation, and was moved to tears by the beauty of
  Rust's syntax.
- Rust is the language of the moment, with execution speed comparable to C and
  C++, and an ownership system that allows for safe programming.

2021/12:

- I learn about dotfiles, a program to set up a development environment, and
  start writing
  [a program to automatically build a windows development environment](https://github.com/SARDONYX-sard/dotfiles),
  following the example of others.
